/**
 * What the aggregate promises about itself, checked where it cannot be evaded.
 *
 * The boundary rules say who may write to an aggregate. They do not say what
 * the aggregate is allowed to be once written, and that is the other half of
 * why a boundary exists: an order with no lines is not a smaller order, it is
 * not an order. Evans calls the root the thing that keeps the invariant; up
 * to here the generated root had nothing to keep it with.
 *
 *   Order:
 *     meta: entity @root @invariant(items.size > 0, 'an order has at least one line')
 *
 * Written more than once for more than one promise. The condition is read,
 * not evaluated: this is a small grammar of field-and-comparison, deliberately
 * not an expression language. A generator that accepts arbitrary expressions
 * has to parse them, and a parser that is nearly right is worse than a form
 * that is obviously limited - the DSL would start looking like a place to put
 * logic, which is the one thing it is not.
 *
 * <h3>Where the check runs</h3>
 *
 * At {@code @PrePersist} and {@code @PreUpdate}, so it runs when the row is
 * written and on every path that writes one. Chapter 5 sketched calling it at
 * the end of each state-changing method instead; that was written before
 * there were generated state-changing methods to speak of, and it would have
 * covered only the ones this generator happens to own. A caller that sets a
 * field through a setter, or a service that changes two things and saves
 * once, would have walked past it. The persistence callback is the same
 * argument the domain events made and won: saving is the moment the aggregate
 * becomes a fact, so it is the moment to insist it is a valid one.
 *
 * <h3>Why a listener rather than a method on the root</h3>
 *
 * JPA allows one callback method per event per class, and the root already
 * spends its {@code @PrePersist} on generating an id. A second one is not a
 * warning - the persistence unit refuses to start, which is how this was
 * found: every test in the sample failed at context load, none of them at an
 * assertion. So the check is a class of its own and is named in
 * {@code @EntityListeners}, which takes a list precisely because more than
 * one concern wants to watch the same events.
 *
 * The failure is an {@link IllegalStateException} and not a validation
 * message, because this is not user input being rejected - it is the domain
 * saying it has been put into a state it promised never to be in. Bean
 * Validation is the right tool for the other one and is already generated
 * from @length and friends.
 *
 * <h3>A member leaving is a write to its root</h3>
 *
 * Running on the root's write alone meant not running when there was no write
 * on the root: removing an aggregate's last member deletes the member's row
 * and leaves the root's, so the promise could be broken by subtraction. It
 * was stated as a limitation and held down by a test.
 *
 * Closed by a second listener, on each member of a root that promises
 * anything: when a member row is deleted, the root's promises are checked on
 * what the root still holds. It runs at flush - after a replace has refilled
 * the collection - so swapping every line at once is still allowed, which is
 * why the check could not live in the remove method itself. The remove
 * method keeps the member's reference to its root so the listener can find
 * it; the row is deleted at the same flush.
 *
 * Promises are declared on roots only: a member has no promise of its own to
 * keep - the boundary took that away. Java and Kotlin; TypeScript gets the
 * question, not the enforcement (see ts-model).
