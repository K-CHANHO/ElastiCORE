/**
 * The artifact extension point, asked the questions its consumers asked it.
 *
 * Every defect this mechanism has had arrived the same way: a second consumer
 * did something the first had not, and an assumption nobody had written down
 * turned out to be load-bearing. Four times.
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li>a set contributing more than one artifact of a target could not tell
 *       which it was writing - the entity path had no artifact name</li>
 *   <li>the same, on the domain path, when domain services arrived</li>
 *   <li>a contributed artifact was placed with a hard-coded Java target, so
 *       selecting the Kotlin bundle wrote a .java file</li>
 *   <li>contributed artifacts were skipped entirely when a project named no
 *       rules of its own, because the walk read the configured list and a
 *       null meant "return"</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * The pattern is that each was found by a consumer rather than by a test, so
 * these are the axes written down as tests instead: how many artifacts, which
 * subject, which namespace, which language, and whether anything was
 * configured. A fifth axis nobody has exercised is worth more as a question
 * here than as a surprise later.
