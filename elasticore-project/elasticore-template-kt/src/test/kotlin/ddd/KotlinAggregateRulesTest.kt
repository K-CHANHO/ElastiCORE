/**
 * The DDD rules, in the other language, actually running.
 *
 * The Java sample proves these patterns through a persistence context, which
 * this module has no harness for. What is language-specific is not the JPA
 * behaviour but the source that was generated - a nullable property read with
 * the wrong assertion, or a comparison written the way Java writes it, is a
 * compile error at best and a wrong answer at worst. So the generated Kotlin
 * is called directly.
 *
 * Outside src/test/kotlin/io on purpose: the generation task empties that
 * tree on every run, and a hand-written test living in it would vanish.
