/**
 * A hand-written consumer of the generated browser model.

 * Type-checked with the generated files on every build, which is what makes
 * it a gate: a renamed specification, a changed signature or a DTO field that
 * stopped existing fails here rather than in somebody's application.
 *
 * It asserts types, not behaviour - nothing runs it. Behaviour is held down
 * where it can be: the same condition grammar produces Java and Kotlin, and
 * both are executed against a database in their own samples, so what is left
 * for this side is the spelling. That is asserted in the generator's own
 * tests, which check that a decimal comes out as Number(...) and a collection
 * as .length.
 *
 * Not in src/main/ts itself, because the generation task empties that
 * directory of *.ts on every run.
