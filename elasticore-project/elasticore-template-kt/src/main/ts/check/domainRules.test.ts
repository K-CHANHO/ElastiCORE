/**
 * The generated browser model, executed.
 *
 * Type-checking proved the generated TypeScript is well-formed and that a
 * consumer still compiles against it. It could not prove the rules answer
 * correctly, and on this side that gap is not academic: a decimal is declared
 * a number, as Jackson writes it, but a server set to write decimals as
 * strings sends "150.00" - and a comparison that is wrong about the type is
 * one TypeScript accepts and JavaScript answers false to, whatever the amount.
 * The one defect this language invites is precisely the one a type check
 * cannot see.
 *
 * So these run. The same rules are executed against a database in the Java
 * and Kotlin samples; this is the third language saying the same answers.
